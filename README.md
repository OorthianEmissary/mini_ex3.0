Desc: The rectangle with the smoothed edges along with the ellipse within with their randomly changing colours, doesn't do anything else than that. They drawn and change color. The text "not frozen" underneath underlines the inherent parody that this throbber is compared to normal onces. It doesn't show if it's actually loading, only that the screen isn't frozen.

We see now, how the program itself can be critical towards other mainstream ways of doing things online. The throbber is used to convey that something is loading, but it doesn't show how much have loaded or if something loads at all.
